  "Add include paths need by LIB to semantic."
  (interactive

     ;; Find out all the libraries installed on this system.
     (unless flycheck-pkg-config--libs
       (flycheck-pkg-config--set-libs))
     (list (completing-read "Library name: " flycheck-pkg-config--libs))))

  (let (;; Find the include paths, e.g. "-I/usr/lib/foo"
        (include-paths (flycheck-pkg-config--include-paths lib)))
    ;; Add include paths unless already present.
    (mapc #'semantic-add-system-include include-paths)
    (if flycheck-mode
        ;; Finally, do the same thing with flycheck-pkg-config
        (flycheck-pkg-config lib))
